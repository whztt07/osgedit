*** BUILD AND INSTALL

You can build OSGEdit in two ways: debug or release. In debug mode, you 
doesn't have to install it, it can be run locally. In release mode, you 
have to install it in order to check it.


A. Debian/Ubuntu

Run 
	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot 
from the top dir and a debian package will be made. Install it normally.


B. Other unices

To compile in debug mode:
scons debug

To compile + install in release mode:
scons install

If you want to compile only in release mode:
scons release


C. Win32

In win32 you can only build in release mode, debug mode is still not 
supported. All that you have to do is to run the build.bat script. If 
you have all the dependencies correctly installed, this will build 
automatically OSGEdit.

NOTE. Multi-thread architectures
If you have an intel core duo/quadro, etc, you can compile with several 
threads this way:
scons -j NTHREADS <target>

You can even make the debian/ubuntu package compiling with several 
threads this way:
SCONS_OPTS='-j NTHREADS' dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

Change NTHREADS with the number of processors/threads of your machine.

Have fun!
